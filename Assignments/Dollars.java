//When I was writing the program, I had trouble with System.out.println. 
//At first, I typed it incorrectly, which caused errors when I tried to compile. 
//I also wrote the word remaining wrong, so the program didnâ€™t recognize the variable. 
//Once I corrected the spelling and used the proper System.out.println statement, the code compiled and ran correctly.
